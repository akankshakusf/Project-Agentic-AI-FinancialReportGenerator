> A powerful OpenAI-powered application demonstrating how **Multi-Agentic AI** is reshaping back-office operations and compliance in finance.

## âš¡ Summary

**FinSight Pro** is a lightweight yet advanced application that uses a **Multi-Agentic Framework** â€” a hot trend in todayâ€™s AI ecosystem â€” to generate professional financial reports autonomously.

Users provide stock tickers, and the system springs into action:
- Gathers real-time market data
- Calculates key financial metrics (P/E, ROE, Dividends, Debt-to-Equity, etc.)
- Analyzes stock correlations
- Fetches recent financial news
- Builds a Markdown report that includes analysis, visuals, and predictions

All this is done using specialized **agents** working collaboratively:
- **Data Analyst Agent** retrieves and crunches numbers  
- **Research Agent** pulls relevant news  
- **Writer Agent** drafts the report  
- **Critic Agent** triggers review and QA  
- **Reviewer Agents** (Legal Agent, Consistency Agent, Alignment Agent, Completion Agent, Meta Agent) ensure correctness, clarity, and completeness  
- **Export Agent** bundles the final output for download  

No APIs, no manual effort â€” just fully autonomous, OpenAI-powered report generation.

## ðŸ§  Why Multi-Agentic AI Matters â€” Especially for Banks

**Banks and financial institutions** face constant pressure to scale operations, comply with regulation, and deliver fast, accurate insights. Multi-Agentic AI systems like FinSight Pro:

- âœ… Automate analyst workflows with audit-friendly outputs  
- âœ… Reduce time spent on manual QA & compliance  
- âœ… Act as intelligent assistants for portfolio and risk teams  

In a world where teams must do more with less, this framework allows for dynamic collaboration between specialized LLM agents â€” mirroring human departments but at machine speed.

> Built with [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) and OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`, this app is cloud-deployable, secure, and designed for real business workflows.
